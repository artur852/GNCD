### How to use

Source the "run_analysis.R" file, and you will have available two functions:

- mergeData()
- buildAveragedDataSet(data.frame df, fileName = NULL)

The **mergeData** function will return a dataset (as a data.frame) which combines both the test and the training data, with appropriate named variables and also using **factors** for **subject** and **activity**

The **buildAveragedDataSet** function takes as input the dataset that was generated by **mergeData** and an optional **file name** and returns a dataset (as a data.frame) with the **average** for each variable for each **subject**/**activity** combination. If **fileName** was provided, this will also print the resulting data.frame into the file.
